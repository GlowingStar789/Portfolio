<h1>Amazing Movies Based On My Experience</h1>
<h2>3 Of The Most Memorable Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Super Mario Bros Movie</h3>

<p>
  While the storyline is different in comparison to the video game that it is based on, it is still a remarkable representation of the iconic Mario Nintendo franchise<br />
  Overall a very thrilling CGI action movie
</p>

<h3>The FNAF Movie</h3>

<p>
  A movie based on the horror game of the same name. While it is a horror movie, it isn't that scary. At least just a few scares.<br />
  The way it interpreted the storyline of the events throughout the first FNAF game and a bit of the third game was spot on
</p>

<h3>The Barbie Movie</h3>

<p>
  This movie is a good example of don't judge a book by it's cover. While its based on a doll toy children play with, the movie has a really deep meaning.<br />
  It really stands out from other barbie moviess, its not a typical one
